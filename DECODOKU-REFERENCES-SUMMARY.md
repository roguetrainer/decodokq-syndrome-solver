## References to Original Code Repository

Throughout the documentation, we reference:

**Original Repository**: [github.com/quantumjim/decodoku](https://github.com/quantumjim/decodoku)

This is mentioned in:
- ORIGINAL-DECODOKU-GAME.md (multiple times)
- README.md (acknowledgments)
- GAMES-README.md (references and acknowledgments)

## Key Messages Communicated

### 1. Attribution

We clearly state that this project:
- Builds upon Decodoku's foundation
- Uses code shared by Dr. James Wootton
- Extends the concept to different quantum codes
- Follows Decodoku's spirit of accessible quantum education

### 2. Differences

We explain how Decodok-Q differs from original Decodoku:

| Aspect | Original Decodoku | Decodok-Q |
|--------|-------------------|-----------|
| Codes | Qudit surface codes (d=10) | Steane & Reed-Muller (d=2) |
| Focus | Research contribution | Education & visualization |
| Platform | Mobile apps | Jupyter notebooks |
| Geometry | 2D lattice | Fano plane & Tetrahedron |

### 3. Gratitude

Every major document includes explicit thanks to:
- Dr. James Wootton (creator)
- The Decodoku community
- NCCR QSIT (funding organization)

## Name Convention: "Decodok-Q"

Following Decodoku's tradition of replacing "u" with "q" (because it rhymes!), we named this project:

**Decodok-Q** = Decodoku + Q (for Quantum/Qubits)

This playful homage is explained in ORIGINAL-DECODOKU-GAME.md.

## Educational Philosophy Alignment

We align with Wootton's philosophy that:
- Quantum computing should be accessible through games
- The public can contribute to quantum research
- Games provide intuition that complements math
- Education should be playful and engaging
