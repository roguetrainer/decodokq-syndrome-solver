🎮⚛️ Excited to share Codo-Q: an open-source platform for learning QUANTUM ERROR CORRECTION (QEC) through interactive games! ⚛️🕵️‍♀️✅
👷🏽‍♀️ Building on Giants: 
Extending Decodoku's Vision for Quantum Education 👨🏼‍🏫⚛️

Inspired by the pioneering work of Dr. James Wootton and his team on Decodoku - which brilliantly demonstrated that QEC could be both accessible and engaging through gaming - Codo-Q extends this vision to QUBIT STABILIZER CODES with rich geometric structures.

The project features:
• Interactive visualizations of the Steane [[7,1,3]] code using Fano plane geometry
• Educational games for practicing SYNDROME DECODING
• Extensible Python backend for exploring multiple code families
• Jupyter notebooks for hands-on learning

Full transparency: we provide no guarantee that the games are fun to play. Yet. Baby steps! 🥱

But if you're interested in QEC, educational game design, or just want to explore the beautiful geometry underlying these codes, try:

Huge thanks to Dr. James Wootton for showing us that quantum computing education should be playful, accessible, and engaging. This project builds on that foundation.
